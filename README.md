# FAQ:


## What is this?

This is pretty much just a clone of something called [omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy), but with a setup very similar to theprimeagen's (which is why it's called Theomarchagen... I'm very funny)

## What is omarchy?

It's a pre-configured arch and hyprland setup that can be fully installed with a script. It also includes serveral apps. It's pretty much just a whole pc from 1 script.

## Why?

for fun. Also because I want to share my configuration with other people.

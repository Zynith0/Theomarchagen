# FAQ:


## What is this?

This is pretty much just a clone of something called [omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy), but with a setup very similar to theprimeagen's (which is why it's called Theomarchagen... I'm very funny)

## What is omarchy?

It's a pre-configured arch and hyprland setup that can be fully installed with a script. It also includes serveral apps. It's pretty much just a whole pc from 1 script.

## Why?

for fun. Also because I want to share my configuration with other people.

# NOTE

this is **VERY** much in beta and in it's current state does not work if you use it from a clean install. It currently expects you to have working audio. I will continue to work on it and make it better. Eventually I plan to make it have the ease of use and user experience of omarchy, if not better. Oh yeah, it also uses dvorak.
